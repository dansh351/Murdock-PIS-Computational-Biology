# Murdock-PIS-Computational-Biology
In this course we will use common and not so common bioinformatics tools to analyze genomic and metagenomic data using both graphical user interfaces and command line tools. We will also be exploring ways to integrate these tools into your classroom, from short term activities to longer project based modules. 
 A basic understanding of Unix commands is helpful but not necessary.
