#Download Centrifuge

Download sourcecode.tar.gz from https://github.com/DaehwanKimLab/centrifuge/releases

#Extract downloaded file and move to the home directory

tar zxvf centrifuge-1.0.4-beta.tar.gz
mv centrifuge-1.0.4-beta ..
cd

#Prepare centrifuge executables to run
cd centrifuge-1.0.4-beta
make


#After make has finished, you will need to add the Centrifuge directory to the PATH variable to make it executable from anywhere

nano ~/.bashrc

#Scroll to the end and type the following:

export PATH=/home/dansh/centrifuge-1.0.4-beta:$PATH
                    #Make sure you change the username to your own
ctrl-O #hit enter
ctrl-X

source .bashrc


#Centrifuge uses an index of known sequences to identify unknowns.  You can download it here:
https://genome-idx.s3.amazonaws.com/centrifuge/p%2Bh%2Bv.tar.gz

#You can keep this in the "Downloads" directory, or move it to the "centrifuge-1.0.4-beta" directory, or wherever it makes sense. I actually keep mine on an external hard drive so I don't take up too much space on my computer's hard drive
#For this example, we will move it to a specified directory in the the centrifuge-1.0.4-beta directory

mkdir ~/centrifuge-1.0.4-beta/Index
mv ~/Downloads/p+h+v.tar.gz ~/centrifuge-1.0.4-beta
cd ~/centrifuge-1.0.4-beta
tar xvf p+h+v.tar.gz

#Once that has completed (it takes a minute), check to make sure the index files were extracted to the correct location and then remove the tar file to save hard drive space

rm p+h+v.tar.gz

#Should work!  Try it out by typing: 

centrifuge
